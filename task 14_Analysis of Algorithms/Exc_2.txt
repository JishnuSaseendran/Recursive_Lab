Exercise 2  
Read the Wikipedia page on sorting algorithms at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm and answer the following questions:

1,What is a “comparison sort?” What is the best worst-case order of growth for a comparison sort? What is the best worst-case order of growth for any sort algorithm?

2,What is the order of growth of bubble sort, and why does Barack Obama think it is “the wrong way to go?”

Ans : This algorithm's average time and worst-case performance is O(n2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be 	   used to sort a small number of items. 

3,What is the order of growth of radix sort? What preconditions do we need to use it?

Ans : Radix sort is an algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. n numbers consisting of k digits each are sorted in O(n · k)     	    time. Radix sort can process digits of each number either starting from the least significant digit (LSD) or starting from the most significant 	    digit (MSD).

4,What is a stable sort and why might it matter in practice?

5,What is the worst sorting algorithm (that has a name)?

6,What sort algorithm does the C library use? What sort algorithm does Python use? Are these algorithms stable? You might have to Google around to 
find these answers.

7,Many of the non-comparison sorts are linear, so why does does Python use an O(n logn) comparison sort?
