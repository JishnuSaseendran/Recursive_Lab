Exercise 1  
Read the Wikipedia page on Big-Oh notation at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation and answer the following questions:
	
	
	1),	What is the order of growth of n3 + n2? What about 1000000 n3 + n2? What about n3 + 1000000 n2?

	O(n^3)
	

	2),	What is the order of growth of (n2 + n) · (n + 1)? Before you start multiplying, remember that you only need the leading term.

	O(n^3)
	

	3),	If f is in O(g), for some unspecified function g, what can we say about af+b?


	4),	If f1 and f2 are in O(g), what can we say about f1 + f2?

	O(g)

	
	5),	If f1 is in O(g) and f2 is in O(h), what can we say about f1 + f2?

	O(|g|+|h|)


	6),	If f1 is in O(g) and f2 is O(h), what can we say about f1 · f2?

	O(gh)
